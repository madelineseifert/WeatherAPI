The highest temperature by latitude does form a predictable curve, however, it is not centered around the equator. Instead the highest point in the curve of the graph is centered around 20 degrees latitude. This is because it is summer in the Northern hemisphere so the highest temperatures are slightly north of the equator. There does not seem to be a relationship between humidity and latitude. There also does not seem to be a relationship between cloudiness and latitude or wind speed and latitude.
